Hi, I'm Ian.

I spend a lot of my time (and generally enjoy) working on machines; mainly electronic and software machines, but also mechanical ones.
I also spend a bit of time (and generally enjoy) doing mammalian things like sleeping and eating.

Currently I live way down South in Dunedin, New Zealand, but I am originally from Northeast Georgia in the USA.
I also lived for a while in Colorado, and have spent some time in Antarctica.

When I was little, I thought the Ninja Turtles were pretty cool, then decided TV was lame and virtual reality was way more interesting than school.
Then I spent a long while fixing computers, making stoves from old beer cans, walking around, riding my bike, and pumping gas through big hoses.
In 2011, I moved to Christchurch, New Zealand, and guessed earthquake magnitudes between testing and building power electronics.
After that, my job changed to keeping computers happy so they could count neutrinos at the South Pole.
Most recently I set off to build a robot army, but got distracted by making better open source tools for building said robot army.

Some tools I like using are Python 3, C++11, good soldering irons, lathes, tricams, wool socks, nice sharp flat files, and Husqvarna chainsaws.
On the other hand, I can use Phillips screws, Bash scripts, hot glue guns, and Visual Studio even if I don't really like to.

In case you wanted to know more about this little site; it's generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a theme based on [Taken](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/taken-theme/) and hosted on [github](https://github.com).
I'm OK working with git, but am a complete Ruby newbie and haven't learned modern HTML worth a damn, so apologies for any difficulties you might encounter while reading this blog or as a result of reading this blog.

Photos are mine unless attributed otherwise or obviously not real.
I do not recommend acting on anything you find here.
