Maybe in _The Future_ I'll fill this entry in a bit more, but for now it's just a couple notes on gearing design books.

The various editions and permutations of __Dudley's Handbook of Practical Gear Design and Manufacture__ seem to be the standard.

__Gear Geometry and Applied Theory__ - looks like a good bet for writing CAD gearing tools.
