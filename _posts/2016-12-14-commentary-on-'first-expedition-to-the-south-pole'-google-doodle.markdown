title: "Commentary on 'first expedition to the south pole' google doodle"

I'm a bit conflicted on today's [google doodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle).
It's great to recognise Amundsen's expedition to South Pole, and the graphic has a nice visual aesthetic, but I'm disappointed that some of it's simplest elements are so wrong.

South Pole - Antarctica in general - is a really special place.
I think it's typical for people who've spent much time there to want to share the place, and what makes it special.
Maybe that's why I find it annoying that google would contribute to misunderstandings of the South Pole?

Amundsen got to South Pole about a week before the summer solstice, about the equivalent of 11:30am in the Pole's one-day year.
There's no dark sky at Pole for a few months either side of the solstice, certainly no stars.
Amundsen knew that; it would be surprising if they took a lantern on the journey to Polheim (the name they gave the camp at Pole).

South Pole is flat.
Imagine the surrounding geography as the middle of a frozen sea, with no shore in sight.
There are no mountains on the horizon, the closest thing you'll see is an [occasional mirage](https://weaknuclearforce.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/atmosphere/) when the weather cooperates.
Contributing to the "frozen sea" analogy, [sastrugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sastrugi) made by the (generally light or nonexistent) wind moving snow (actually fine ice crystals) around look like frozen waves.

Anyway, there's my rant.
