title: "Tax Treaty between United States and New Zealand"
categories:
---

Rather annoyingly, the current tax treaty between the United States and New Zealand seems to be available in the form of two "schedules"; the first is the original 1983 treaty, the second is a set of changes from 2009 to be applied on to the first.  It's hard to read, but if you want to it's [here](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1983/0196/latest/whole.html).

Below is my best effort at applying the changes listed in schedule 2 on to schedule 1.  I'm not a lawyer nor tax expert, this is not legal advice, read further at your own risk.  Sorry about the formatting.

    3.Except to the extent provided in paragraph 4, this Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)) and its citizens.

        (b)the benefits conferred in a Contracting State under the Convention in accordance with Articles 19 (Government Service), 20 (Students), and 26 (Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers), upon individuals who are neither citizens of, nor have immigrant status in, that State.

        (i)for purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that any question arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention and, in particular, whether a taxation measure is within the scope of this Convention, shall be determined exclusively in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of this Convention; and

        (ii)the provisions of Article XVII (National Treatment) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services shall not apply to a taxation measure unless the competent authorities agree that the measure is not within the scope of Article 23 (Non-Discrimination) of this Convention.

      (b)For the purposes of this paragraph, a `measure' is a law, regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action, or any similar provision or action.

    6.An item of income, profit or gain derived through an entity that is fiscally transparent under the laws of either Contracting State shall be considered to be derived by a resident of a State to the extent that the item is treated for purposes of the taxation law of such Contracting State as the income, profit or gain of a resident.

Article 2
Taxes Covered

    1.This Convention shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.

    2.There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property.

    3.The existing taxes to which this Convention shall apply are:

        (a)in the case of New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as New Zealand tax);

        (b)in the case of the United States: the Federal income taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (but excluding social security and unemployment taxes), and the Federal excise taxes imposed with respect to private foundations (hereinafter referred to as United States tax).

    4.This Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes.

Article 5

    1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

        (e)a workshop; and

        (f)a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources.

    3.A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months.

    4.An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities in that State for more than twelve months in connection with a building site, or construction or installation project which is being undertaken in that State.

    5.  
        (a)Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 an enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if it carries on activities in that State in connection with the exploration or exploitation of natural resources situated in that State;

        (b)The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not apply if such activities are carried on for a period not exceeding six months in the aggregate in any consecutive twelve month period. However for the purposes of this subparagraph activities carried on in that State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be regarded as carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if those activities are connected with activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons.

    6.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article an enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be regarded as having a permanent establishment solely as a result of one or more of the following:

        (a)the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

        (b)the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery;

        (c)the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;

        (d)the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;

        (e)the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

    7.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies—is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has and habitually exercises in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.

    8.An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent, or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.

    9.The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

Article 6
Income from Real Property

    1.Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from real property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other state.

    2.The term “real property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to real property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of real property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources. Ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as real property.

    3.The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, subletting or use in any other form of real property.

    4.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from real property of an enterprise.

Article 7
Business Profits

    1.The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

    2.Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with any other associated enterprise.

    3.In determining the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses, research and development expenses and interest, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

    4.No business profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

    5.The business profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

    6.Where business profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of the Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

    7.Nothing in this Article shall prevent either Contracting State from taxing according to its law the income or profits from the business of any form of insurance.

    8.In applying this Article, paragraph 6 of Article 10 (Dividends), paragraph 4 of Article 11 (Interest), paragraph 4 of Article 12 (Royalties), and paragraph 6 of Article 13 (Alienation of Property), any income or gain attributable to a permanent establishment during its existence is taxable in the Contracting State where such permanent establishment is situated even if the payments are deferred until such permanent establishment has ceased to exist.

    9.Where:

        (a)a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether directly or through one or more interposed fiscally transparent entities or trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee(s) of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

        (b)in relation to that enterprise, that resident would have a permanent establishment in that other State if the resident carried on the business of the enterprise in its own capacity,

    then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee(s) shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident's share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

Article 8
Shipping and Air Transport

    1.Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

    2.Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State referred to in paragraph 1 from the rental of ships or aircraft or from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers) shall be taxable only in that State to the extent that those ships, aircraft or containers are used in international traffic and such profits are incidental to the profits of that enterprise described in paragraph 1.

    3.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from participation in a pool, a joint business, or an international operating agency.

Article 9
Associated Enterprises

    1.Where

        (a)an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

        (b)the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

    and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which, but for those conditions would have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

    2.Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State, and takes accordingly, profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State, and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be paid to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

    3.Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that, on the basis of available information, the determination of that tax liability is consistent with the principles stated in this Article.

Article 10
Dividends

    1.Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

    2.However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the dividends are beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, except as otherwise provided, the tax so charged shall not exceed:

        (a)5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that owns directly at least 10 percent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends;

        (b)15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

    This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

    3.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, such dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 percent or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividends for a 12-month period ending on the date on which entitlement to the dividends is determined and:

        (a)satisfies the conditions of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph 2(c) of Article 16 (Limitation on Benefits);

        (b)satisfies the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2(e) of Article 16, provided that the company satisfies the conditions described in paragraph 3 of that Article with respect to the dividends; or

        (c)has received a determination pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 16 with respect to this paragraph.

    4.  
        (a)Paragraphs 2(a) and 3 shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC) or a U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). In the case of dividends paid by a RIC, paragraph 2(b) shall apply. In the case of dividends paid by a REIT, paragraph 2(b) shall apply only if:

            (i)the beneficial owner of the dividends is an individual or pension fund, in either case holding an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT;

            (ii)the dividends are paid with respect to a class of stock that is publicly traded and the beneficial owner of the dividends is a person holding an interest of not more than 5 percent of any class of the REIT's stock; or

            (iii)the beneficial owner of the dividends is a person holding an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT and the REIT is diversified.

        (b)For the purposes of this paragraph, a REIT shall be `diversified' if the value of no single interest in real property exceeds 10 percent of its total interests in real property. For the purposes of this rule, foreclosure property shall not be considered an interest in real property. Where a REIT holds an interest in a partnership, it shall be treated as owning directly a proportion of the partnership's interests in real property corresponding to its interest in the partnership.

    5.For purposes of this Article, the term `dividends' means income from shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as income that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares under the laws of the State of which the payer is a resident.

    6.The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply.

    7.A Contracting State may not impose any tax on dividends paid by a resident of the other State, except insofar as the dividends are paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment, nor may it impose tax on a corporation's undistributed profits, except as provided in paragraph 8, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that State.

    8.A company that is a resident of New Zealand and that has a permanent establishment in the United States or that is subject to tax in the United States on a net basis on its income that may be taxed in the United States under Article 6 (Income from Real Property) or under paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Alienation of Property) may be subject in the United States to a tax in addition to the tax allowable under the other provisions of this Convention. Such tax, however, may be imposed on only the portion of the business profits of the company attributable to the permanent establishment and the portion of the income that is subject to tax under Article 6 or under paragraph 1 of Article 13 that, in the United States, represents the dividend equivalent amount of such profits or income.

    9.The tax referred to in paragraph 8 shall not be imposed at a rate exceeding the rate specified in paragraph 2(a). In any case, it shall not be imposed on a company that:

        (a)satisfies the conditions of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph 2(c) of Article 16 (Limitation on Benefits);

        (b)satisfies the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2(e) of Article 16, provided that the company satisfies the conditions described in paragraph 3 of that Article with respect to an item of income, profit or gain described in paragraph 8 of this Article; or

        (c)has received a determination pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 16 with respect to this paragraph.

Article 11
Interest

    1.Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

    2.However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest.

    3.Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest shall be exempt from tax by the Contracting State where it arises if the interest is:

        (a)beneficially owned by the other Contracting State or an instrumentality of that Contracting State which is not subject to tax on its income by that State;

        (b)beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State with respect to debt obligations guaranteed or insured by that State or an instrumentality of that State which is not subject to tax on its income by that State; or

        (c)beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State that is either:

            (i)a bank; or

            (ii)an enterprise substantially deriving its gross income from the active and regular conduct of a lending or finance business involving transactions with unrelated parties;

        that is unrelated to the payer of the interest. For purposes of this subparagraph (c), the term `lending or finance business' includes the business of:

            (A)making loans;

            (B)purchasing or discounting accounts receivable, notes, or installment obligations;

            (C)engaging in finance leasing (including entering into finance leases and purchasing, servicing, and disposing of finance leases and related leased assets);

            (D)issuing letters of credit or providing guarantees; or

            (E)providing charge and credit card services.

    4.The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply.

    5.Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority, or resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

    6.Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of the Convention.

    7.The term `interest' as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums or prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, and all other income that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises. Income dealt with in Article 10 (Dividends) and penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Convention.

    8.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3:

        (a)interest arising in the United States that is contingent interest of a type that does not qualify as portfolio interest under United States law may be taxed by the United States but, if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of New Zealand, the interest may be taxed at a rate not exceeding 15 percent of the gross amount of the interest; and

        (b)interest that is an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit may be taxed by the United States in accordance with its domestic law.

    9.In the case of the United States, the excess, if any, of the amount of interest allocable to the profits of a company resident in the other Contracting State that are either attributable to the permanent establishment in the United States or subject to tax in the United States under Article 6 (Income from Real Property) or paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Alienation of Property) over the interest paid by that permanent establishment or trade or business in the United States shall be deemed to arise in the United States and be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State. The tax imposed under this Article on such interest shall not exceed the rate provided for in paragraph 2, unless the company is described in paragraph 3, in which case it shall be exempt from such taxation in that other Contracting State.

    10.Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph (c) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest if:

        (a)in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph (a) shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds two percent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, `approved issuer levy' includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; or

        (b)it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

    11.Nothing in this Article shall be construed as restricting, in any manner, the right of a Contracting State to apply any anti-avoidance provisions of its taxation law.

Article 12
Royalties

    1.Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

    2.However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 percent of the gross amount of the royalties.

    3.The term `royalties' as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematographic films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience. The term `royalties' also includes income or gains from the alienation of any property or rights described in this paragraph to the extent that such income or gains are contingent on productivity, use or disposition of such property or rights.

    4.The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply.

    5.  
        (a)Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

        (b)Where subparagraph (a) does not operate to deem royalties as arising in either Contracting State and the royalties relate to the use of, or the right to use, in one of the Contracting States, any property or right described in paragraph 3, the royalties shall be deemed to arise in that State.

    6.Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right, or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of the Convention.

Article 13
Alienation of Property

    1.Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation or disposition of real property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

    2.For the purposes of this Article:

        (a)the term “real property situated in the other Contracting State”, where the United States is that other Contracting State, includes a United States real property interest, and real property referred to in Article 6 which is situated in the United States; and

        (b)the term “real property”, in the case of New Zealand, includes:

            (i)real property referred to in Article 6;

            (ii)shares or comparable interests in a company, the assests of which consist wholly or principally of real property situated in New Zealand; and

            (iii)an interest in a partnership, trust, or estate of a deceased individual, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property situated in New Zealand.

    3.Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships, aircraft or containers operated or used in international traffic shall, except to the extent to which that enterprise has been allowed depreciation in the other Contracting State in respect of those ships, aircraft or containers, be taxable only in the first-mentioned State.

    4.Income or gains described in paragraph 3(b) of Article 12 (Royalties) shall be taxable only in accordance with the provisions of Article 12.

    5.For the purposes of this Article, real property consisting of shares in a company referred to in paragraph 2(b)(ii), and interests in a partnership, trust or estate referred to in paragraph 2(b)(iii), shall be deemed to be situated in New Zealand.

    6.Income or gains from the alienation of personal property which are attributable to a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has or had in the other Contracting State, and gains from the alienation of such permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) may be taxed in that other State.

    7.Where an individual who, upon ceasing to be a resident of one of the Contracting States, is treated under the taxation law of that State as having alienated any property for its fair market value and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for purposes of taxation in the other Contracting State as if the individual had, immediately before ceasing to be a resident of the first-mentioned State, alienated and reacquired such property for an amount equal to its fair market value at such time.

    8.Income or gains from the alienation of any property other than property referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.

Article 14 has been deleted

Article 15
Dependent Personal Services

    1.Subject to the provisions of Articles 18 (Pensions and Annuities) and 19 (Government Service), salaries, wages, and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.

    2.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:

        (a)the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any consecutive twelve month period; and

        (b)the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and

        (c)the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.

    3.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment as a member of the regular complement of a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic may be taxed only in that State.

Article 16
Limitation on Benefits

    1.Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of a Contracting State shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Convention otherwise accorded to residents of a Contracting State unless such resident is a `qualified person' as defined in paragraph 2.

    2.A resident of a Contracting State shall be a qualified person for a taxable year if the resident is:

        (a)an individual;

        (b)a Contracting State, or a political subdivision or local authority thereof;

        (c)a company, if:

            (i)its principal class of shares (and any disproportionate class of shares) is regularly traded on one or more recognized stock exchanges; and either:

                (A)its principal class of shares is primarily traded on one or more recognized stock exchanges located in the Contracting State of which the company is a resident; or

                (B)the company's primary place of management and control is in the Contracting State of which it is a resident; or

            (ii)at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of the shares (and at least 50 percent of any disproportionate class of shares) in the company is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer companies entitled to benefits under clause (i) of this subparagraph, provided that, in the case of indirect ownership, each intermediate owner is a resident of either Contracting State;

        (d)a person described in paragraphs 1(a) or 1(b) of Article 4 (Residence) of this Convention, provided that, in the case of a person described in subclause (A) of clause (i) of paragraph 1(1) of Article 3 (General Definitions), more than 50 percent of the person's beneficiaries, members or participants are individuals resident in either Contracting State; or

        (e)a person other than an individual, if:

            (i)on at least half the days of the taxable year, persons who are residents of that Contracting State and that are entitled to the benefits of this Convention under subparagraph (a), subparagraph (b), clause (i) of subparagraph (c), or subparagraph (d) of this paragraph own, directly or indirectly, shares or other beneficial interests representing at least 50 percent of the aggregate voting power and value (and at least 50 percent of any disproportionate class of shares) of the person, provided that, in the case of indirect ownership, each intermediate owner is a resident of that Contracting State, and

            (ii)less than 50 percent of the person's gross income for the taxable year, as determined in the person's State of residence, is paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to persons who are not residents of either Contracting State entitled to the benefits of this Convention under subparagraph (a), subparagraph (b), clause (i) of subparagraph (c), or subparagraph (d) of this paragraph in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of the taxes covered by this Convention in the person's State of residence (but not including arm's length payments in the ordinary course of business for services or tangible property and payments in respect of financial obligations to a bank that is not related to the payor).

    3.(a)A resident of a Contracting State will be entitled to benefits of the Convention with respect to an item of income derived from the other State, regardless of whether the resident is a qualified person, if the resident is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in the first-mentioned State (other than the business of making or managing investments for the resident's own account, unless these activities are banking, insurance or securities activities carried on by a bank, insurance company or registered securities dealer), and the income derived from the other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, that trade or business.

        (b)If a resident of a Contracting State derives an item of income from a trade or business activity conducted by that resident in the other Contracting State, or derives an item of income arising in the other Contracting State from a related person, the conditions described in subparagraph (a) shall be considered to be satisfied with respect to such item only if the trade or business activity carried on by the resident in the first-mentioned Contracting State is substantial in relation to the trade or business activity carried on by the resident or such person in the other Contracting State. Whether a trade or business activity is substantial for the purposes of this paragraph will be determined based on all the facts and circumstances.

        (c)In determining whether a person is `engaged' in the active conduct of a trade or business in a Contracting State under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, activities conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and activities conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person. A person shall be connected to another if one possesses at least 50 percent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of the company's shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or another person possesses at least 50 percent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of the company's shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in each person. In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons.

    4.If a resident of a Contracting State is neither a qualified person pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 nor entitled to benefits with respect to an item of income under paragraph 3 of this Article the competent authority of the other Contracting State may, nevertheless, grant the benefits of this Convention, or benefits with respect to a specific item of income, if it determines that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of such person and the conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under this Convention.

    5.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, where an enterprise of a Contracting State derives income from the other Contracting State, and that income is attributable to a permanent establishment which that enterprise has in a third jurisdiction, the tax benefits that would otherwise apply under the other provisions of the Convention will not apply to that income if the combined tax that is actually paid with respect to such income in the first-mentioned Contracting State and in the third jurisdiction is less than 60 percent of the tax that would have been payable in the first-mentioned State if the income was earned in that Contracting State by the enterprise and were not attributable to the permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction. Any dividends, interest or royalties to which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax in the other Contracting State at a rate that shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount thereof. Any other income to which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax under the provisions of the domestic law of the other Contracting State, notwithstanding any other provision of the Convention. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if:

        (a)in the case of royalties, the royalties are received as compensation for the use of, or the right to use, intangible property produced or developed by the permanent establishment itself; or

        (b)in the case of any other income, the income derived from the other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, the active conduct of a trade or business carried on by the permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction (other than the business of making, managing or simply holding investments for the enterprise's own account, unless these activities are banking or securities activities carried on by a bank or registered securities dealer).

    6.For purposes of this Article:

        (a)the term `recognized stock exchange' means:

            (i)the NASDAQ System owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and any stock exchange registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

            (ii)the New Zealand Stock Market; and

            (iii)any other stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities;

        (b)the term `principal class of shares' means the ordinary or common shares of the company, provided that such class of shares represents the majority of the voting power and value of the company. If no single class of ordinary or common shares represents the majority of the aggregate voting power and value of the company, the `principal class of shares' are those classes that in the aggregate represent a majority of the aggregate voting power and value of the company;

        (c)the term `disproportionate class of shares' means any class of shares of a company resident in one of the Contracting States that entitles the shareholder to disproportionately higher participation, through dividends, redemption payments or otherwise, in the earnings generated in the other State by particular assets or activities of the company; and

        (d)a company's `primary place of management and control' will be in the Contracting State of which it is a resident only if executive officers and senior management employees exercise day-to-day responsibility for more of the strategic, financial and operational policy decision making for the company (including its direct and indirect subsidiaries) in that State than in any other state and the staff of such persons conduct more of the day-to-day activities necessary for preparing and making those decisions in that State than in any other state.

Article 17
Artistes and Athletes

    1.Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15 (Dependent Personal Services), income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio, or television artiste, or a musician, or as an athlete, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State, except where the amount of the gross receipts derived by such entertainer or athlete, including expenses reimbursed to him or borne on his behalf, from such activities does not exceed ten thousand United States dollars ($10,000) or its equivalent in New Zealand dollars for the income year or taxable year concerned.

    2.Where income in respect of activities exercised by an entertainer or an athlete in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or athlete but to another person, that income of that other person may, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits), be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or athlete are exercised, unless it is established that neither the entertainer or athlete nor persons related thereto participate directly or indirectly in any profits of that other person in any manner whatsoever including (without limitation) the receipt of deferred remuneration, bonuses, fees, dividends, partnership distributions, or other distributions.

Article 18
Pensions and Annuities

    1.Subject to the provisions of Article 19 (Government Service)

        (b)Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State or a citizen of the United States shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State.

    2.Annuities derived and beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. The term “annuities” as used in this paragraph means stated sums (not being alimony) paid periodically at stated times during life or during a specified or ascertainable number of years, under an obligation to make the payments in return for adequate and full consideration (other than services rendered or to be rendered).

Article 19
Government Service
    1.  (a)Remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services in the discharge of functions of a Governmental nature rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.

        (b)However, such remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who:

            (i)is a citizen of that State; or

            (ii)did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services.

    2.  (a)Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.

        (b)However, such pension shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a citizen of, that State.

    3.The provisions of Articles 15 (Dependent Personal Services), 17 (Artistes and Athletes) and 18 (Pensions and Annuities) shall apply to remuneration and pensions in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof.

Article 20
Students

Payments received for the purpose of maintenance or education by a student who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State for the purpose of his full-time education shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise outside that State.

Article 21
Other Income

Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State except that, if such income is derived from sources within the other Contracting State, it may also be taxed in that other State.

Article 22
Relief from Double Taxation

    1.Subject to paragraph 4, and in accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of the law of the United States (as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof), in the case of the United States double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

        (a)the United States shall allow to a resident or citizen of the United States or a United States company as a credit against United States tax the income tax paid to New Zealand by or on behalf of such resident, citizen or company; and

        (b)the United States shall also allow to a United States company owning at least 10 percent of the voting stock of a company (other than a United States company) which is a resident of New Zealand and from which the United States company receives dividends, as a credit against United States tax, the income tax paid to New Zealand by or on behalf of the distributing company with respect to the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

    For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraphs 3(a) and 4 of Article 2 (Taxes Covered) shall be considered income taxes.

    2.In the case of New Zealand, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

    In accordance with, and subject to any provisions of, the law of New Zealand which may from time to time be in force and which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax for tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United States tax paid under the law of the United States and consistently with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand arising in the United States (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income; except that such credit shall not exceed the amount of the tax that would be paid to the United States if the resident were not a United States citizen or a United States company. 

    3.For the purposes of computing United States tax, where a citizen of the United States or a United States company is a resident of New Zealand, the United States shall allow as a credit against United States tax the income tax paid to New Zealand after the credit referred to in paragraph 2. The credit so allowed against United States tax shall not reduce that portion of the United States tax that is creditable against New Zealand tax in accordance with paragraph 2.

    4.For the purpose of allowing relief from double taxation pursuant to this Article, income shall be deemed to arise as follows:

        (a)income derived by a resident of the United States which may be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand;

        (b)income derived by a resident of New Zealand which may be taxed in the United States in accordance with the Convention (other than income taxed by the United States solely because the beneficial owner is a citizen of the United States or a United States company) shall be deemed to arise in the United States;

        (c)For purposes of paragraph 3, income beneficially owned by a resident of New Zealand who is a citizen of the United States or a United States company shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph.

    5.No provision of this Convention relating to source of income shall apply in determining credits against United States tax for foreign taxes other than those referred to in paragraphs 3(a) and 4 of Article 2 (Taxes Covered).

Article 23
Non-Discrimination

    1.Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. However, for the purposes of United States taxation, United States nationals who are subject to tax on a worldwide basis are not in the same circumstances as nationals of New Zealand who are not residents of the United States.

    2.The taxation on a permanent establishment that an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

    3.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities that it grants to its own residents.

    4.Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Interest), or paragraph 6 of Article 12 (Royalties) apply, interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid by a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of the first-mentioned resident, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.

    5.Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.

    6.Nothing in this Article shall be construed as preventing the United States from imposing a tax as described in paragraph 8 of Article 10 (Dividends).

    7.This Article shall not apply to any provision of the taxation laws of a Contracting State which is reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes.

Article 24
Mutual Agreement Procedure

    1.Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or citizen. This case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of that action.

    2.The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

    3.The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

    4.The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

Article 25
Exchange of Information and Administrative Assistance

    1.The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as may be relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes of every kind imposed by a Contracting State to the extent that the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention, including information relating to the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, such taxes. The exchange of information is not restricted by paragraph 1 of Article 1 (General Scope) or Article 2 (Taxes Covered).

    2.Any information received under this Article by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment, collection, or administration of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to above, or the oversight of such functions. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

    3.In no case shall the provisions of the preceding paragraphs be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

        (a)to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

        (b)to supply information that is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

        (c)to supply information that would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

    4.If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitation be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information because it has no domestic interest in such information.

    5.In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information requested by the other Contracting State because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

    6.If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall provide information under this Article in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts, and writings).

    7.Each of the Contracting States shall endeavor to collect on behalf of the other Contracting State such amounts as may be necessary to ensure that relief granted by the Convention from taxation imposed by that other State does not inure to the benefit of persons not entitled thereto. This paragraph shall not impose upon either of the Contracting States the obligation to carry out administrative measures that would be contrary to its sovereignty, security, or public policy.

    8.The requested State shall allow representatives of the requesting State to enter the requested State to interview individuals and examine books and records with the consent of the persons subject to examination.

Article 26
Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

    Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

Article 27
Entry into Force

    1.This Convention shall be subject to ratification in accordance with the applicable procedures of each Contracting State and instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Washington as soon as possible.

    2.The Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions shall have effect:

1. With reference to Articles 11 and 12:

If in any future double taxation convention with any other country, New Zealand agrees to limit its taxation at source on any interest or royalties to rates lower than the ones provided in this Convention, New Zealand shall notify the United States, and the Contracting States shall, at the request of the United States, and without undue delay, consult each other with a view to concluding an additional protocol to incorporate such lower rates into this Convention.

2. With reference to Articles 7, 12 and 21

    So long as New Zealand continues to tax the income of film renters according to section 224 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (including any subsequent enactment which does not affect the general principle thereof) and to exempt from tax in accordance with that section certain payments received from such film renters by persons not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax, the provisions of Articles 7, 12 and 21 of the Convention shall not affect the taxation by New Zealand of such income or the exemption by New Zealand of such payments.
