Years ago, I worked for a big tech company where we had an incredibly useful page on the internal wiki; a list of recommendations for various providers of goods and services in the local area. Then, I quit that job and moved to New Zealand.

Here's a scattered collection of my recommendations, perhaps helpful for folks in Dunedin and NZ:


Bearings and similar: [NZ Miniature Bearings](https://nzminiaturebearings.com)

Dentist: [John Hamilton Dental](https://www.jhdental.nz/)

Industrial surplus; motors, VFDs, chains, gears, material (including new rolled steel), interesting machines... : [Rietveld](https://rietveld.co.nz/)  

Plants, NZ native: [Ribbonwood Nurseries](https://www.ribbonwoodnurseries.co.nz/)

Sharpening, push mower reels in particular: G & J Swann, Bridgman St.

Cordless power tools: [i-tools](https://www.i-tools.co.nz)
